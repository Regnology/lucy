1;License Text in Source;This clause usually refers to source code distribution, which we will almost never do. If we would, this clause required the distributor (us) to include a copy of the license text in the source code and/or accompanying files.
2;Mark modified Files;This clause can refer to source code distribution, but also to binary redestribution which includes non-binary files. In both cases, changes must be explicitly marked and described within the source code and/or in accompanying files.
3;Share modified Source;This requirement usually means a no-go for us. It requires that source code must be made available, either in the documentation or otherwise (e.g. download). Sometimes only the original software needs to be made available. In this case this requirement may not be problematic, if the third party software is used correctly.
4;Share Source;Sometimes when you distribute the Program (or a portion or derivative of it) in object code or executable form you must provide the source code e.g. complete corresponding machine-readable source code or a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party free a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code or to where the corresponding source code may be obtained.
5;Disclaimer or Notice in Documentation;License givers often include a disclaimer to protect them from any claims due to damage from usage of the code. This condition requires us to include that specific disclaimer or notice text to be included in our documentation, or in a file of its own.
6;License Text and Copyright in Documentation;This is a frequently used requirement, compelling us to include the text of the license as well as copyright notices of the original authors (or other copyright holders) in our own software documentation.
7;No Use in Endorsements;Often times the owners of the copyright do not want to be associated without consent to derivative works. This condition states that any marketing, sales or other advertisement of our product must not refer back to them.
8;Disclaimer or Notice in Advertisements;This condition requires us to include a specific disclaimer or notice text in all our marketing/sales/advertisements which describe features of the third party software.
9;Distribution in separated Executable;The component needs to be wrapped into a separate executable which communicates with our program. E.g. via a web-service wrapper which converts the original method calls of the library into web service calls.
10;Downloadable Component;Customers needs to download component by themselves. Must not be in deliverable.
11;License Text in File;We meet this requirement usually at Mozilla licenses. In the license text we have mentioned the obligation to duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code.
12;Change Tracking;Sometimes the license text requires you to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
13;Must not modify Source;Must not modify Source Code (Use Case).
